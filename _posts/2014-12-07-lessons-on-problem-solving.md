excerpt: Or how the obvious solution isn’t always the right one.

Last week, I spent some time collaborating with a developer on a project. The project’s codebase was making it hard for everyone involved—designers, developers, and writers—to iterate, and we knew that it needed to be improved. As the project moved on, we discarded some of our initial decisions, as they were introducing problems, and eventually agreed on a suitable set of tools.

When we started implementing, though, some of our assumptions about how the iteration process should function conflicted. During one of our conversations, we decided to go through each of our options. We each had strong opinions about how the iteration process should work, but we knew we had to settle on the one that would provide the best iterative process for everyone.

After an hour of debate, we eventually found a solution, but not in one of our options, and instead in something entirely different. This came as a surprise, but often times, the best solutions lie beyond our initial considerations. This served as a great reminder of that.
